# Breakout-2D-OpenGL

An iteration of the classic 'Breakout' game implementing basic 2D OpenGL + SDL (University project).

We were asked to replicate the classic game using our knowledge of OpenGL we had learned in lectures and workshops,
while meeting certain criteria.

- The current version of this project has a bug which detects collision for multiple bricks when hitting a certain brick.

NOTE: SDL + OpenGL is needed to compile and run the project correctly.
